Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**!
Here, I store Python programs organized **topic-wise** as I continue my coding journey.
I hope this repo will be useful for **beginners, students, and even interview preparation**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `datatype.py` → Basics of Python datatypes
* `strings.py` → String operations and examples
* *(More files will be added as I learn new topics!)*

## 🎯 Goals

* Learn Python step by step 🧑‍💻
* Store code **topic-wise for clarity**
* Build a strong foundation for **projects & interviews**
* Share my progress with others who are learning Python

## ✅ Topics Covered (so far)

* ✔️ Data Types
* ✔️ Strings
* ⏳ Variables, Functions, Loops, and more coming soon!


## 🤝 Contribution

This is my personal learning repo, but suggestions are always welcome!
Feel free to **fork, star ⭐, or raise an issue** if you’d like to collaborate.


## 💡 Inspiration

This repo is part of my coding journey, and I hope it helps you too.
Stay tuned for more Python topics 🚀


Do you want me to also include a **table of contents (clickable links to each section)** so it looks even more professional?
